# WinTodo
A to-do application written in Visual Basic 3.0, for Windows versions 3.x and higher.

## Setup instructions
Install and open Visual Basic 3.0 Professional Edition. Navigate to File > Open Project and open `tdlist.mak` in the subsequent file open dialog.

This setup has been tested to work on Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, but should theoretically work on any 16-bit version of Windows starting with Windows 3.0, any later 32-bit version of Windows, or 64-bit versions of Windows running OTVDM.
